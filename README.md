*PRECONDITIONS*

First thing first, you have to get your own Trello API key and token by following documentation (https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/guides/rest-api/authorization/).
After that when you have this repo on your own machine you have to copy exact path to file 'board_id.txt' and paste to file 'trello.py' on a 'keys' folder (https://github.com/RobLit/TrelloAPI/blob/master/keys/trello.py).
